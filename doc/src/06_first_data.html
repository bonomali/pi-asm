Using sections and alignment

<p>
This example is a slight modification of the previous one, to
include the use of a section definition. Using such a definition
raises questions about alignment, which is a subject that needs a 
bit of care in assembly programming. 
</p>

<h3>The example</h3>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
// Outputs a simple message using sys_write
  
.section .rodata
msg:
    .ascii "Hello, World\n"

.text
.align 2

SYS_EXIT = 1
SYS_WRITE = 4
STDOUT = 1

.global _start

// Exit the program.
//   On entry, r0 should hold the exit code
exit:
    mov    %r7, $SYS_EXIT
    swi    $0

_start:
    // Use the sys_write syscall to output a string
    mov    %r7, $SYS_WRITE
    mov    %r0, $STDOUT
    ldr    %r1, =msg // Store the address of the message in r1
    mov    %r2, $13  // Store the length of the message in r2
    swi    $0

    // Now exit
    mov    %r0, $0
    b      exit
</pre>

<h3>sections</h3>
</p>
The first thing to note about the example is the new section definition:
<p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
.section .rodata
</pre>

</p>
This indicates that the content that follows, up until the next 
<code>.section</code> statement, should be placed in a section
called <code>.rodata</code>, or <b>r</b>ead <b>o</b>nly <b>data</b>. 
This makes for generally neater organization that just dumping named
data items into the program code, and allows the operating system
to treat this data in a more secure way. For example, Linux
will not allow the program to write to any data in a read-only 
section -- trying to do so will result in an "illegal operation"
signal.
</p>
<p>
A section is simply an indivisible unit of machine code or data. The linker
will aggregate the sections of a particular type, and lay them out in the
executable file in a way that the kernel requires. For our purposes,
three section types are important.
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><p><code>.text</code> -- a section containing executable code. The 
kernel may prevent a program branching to 
a section that is not executable.<p></li>
<li><p><code>.rodata</code> -- read-only data. This is initialized data that cannot be overwritten at run time.</p></li>
<li><p><code>.data</code> -- data that is initialized, but can be overwritten at run time.</p></li>
<li><p><code>.bss</code> -- uninitialized data. A BSS section is writable, but 
initialized to zeros</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these sections is allocated a particular region of the running
process's memory map. 
</p>

<p>
There's no limit to the number of sections that an assembly language program
can define. In fact, it's sometimes useful to define a section for each
function. This is because the linker is able to work out which sections
have no links to them, so they can be removed from the executable file
completely, saving space and making the program slightly quicker to
load.  
</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>
The next statement in the program is:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
.align 2
</pre>

<p>
<i>Alignment</i> is the process of padding out the contents of the
machine code so that particular elements start on particularly 
favourable addresses. This may be done for efficiency, or because
some specification demands it. 
</p>
<p>
In the 32-bit ARM architecture, it's generally most efficient if everything
starts on a 4-byte boundary. That is, each new program instruction or 
new item of data should have an address that is a multiple of four bytes.
With a 32-bit CPU this makes sense -- memory will be read in 4-byte
chunks. If a specific piece of data lies half in one chunk and half in the
next, then it will require a certain amount of decoding to be useful.
The CPU does this decoding, but it's better if it doesn't have to.
</p>
<p>
The ARM ABI additionally requires that any piece of data that is 
"public" must align to 8 bytes. "public" in this context means that
the data is accessible to some other library. My examples are all
self-contained, so I only align to 4-byte boundaries.
</p>
<p>
The "2" in the instruction <code>.align 2</code> refers to the second
bit of the address, and does not mean "2 bytes". This is a little
confusing, because some assemblers and compilers <i>do</i> allow
specific byte intervals to be specified. In practice, on ARM this 
instruction aligns with four (= 2 raised to the power 2) -byte boundaries.  
</p>
<p>
When the assembler encounters an <code>.align</code> instruction, it
simply inserts zeros into the object file until it reaches a
boundary. If the data is already aligned in the required way, then 
the instruction will have no effect. 
</p>
<p>
There's no need to use <code>.align</code> at the start of the file,
because this is address zero. Nor is there any need to use it between
blocks of program code, since ARM instructions are always four bytes
long. <code>.align</code> <i>should</i> be used between sections,
and between data elements. We will see that sometimes alignment has
to be done programatically as well -- but that's for later.
</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The assembler recognizes different types of section, and there advantages to using appropriate numbers and types of sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Assembly programming requires paying attention to alignment.</p></li>
