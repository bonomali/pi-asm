Using constants in assembly programming

<p>
This example makes a slight imrovement to the readability of the 
previous one, but no change to its limited functionality.
</p>

<h3>The example</h3>

<p>
Here is the code.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
// This example illustrate one way to define a constant, to make
//  the code more readble

.text

SYS_EXIT = 1

.global _start

// Exit the program.
//   On entry, r0 should hold the exit code
exit:
    mov    %r7, $SYS_EXIT
    swi    $0

_start:
    mov    %r0, $44
    b      exit
</pre>

<h3>Constants and symbols</h3>
<p>
The only new feature in this example is the use of a constant symbol
that represents the syscall number. You may recall that the syscall
<code>sys_exit</code> has syscall number 1. It's perfectly legitmate
to use the literal number 1, but using the symbol <code>SYS_EXIT</code>
makes the code more readable. If we only use this value once in the
program, a simple comment may make its use clear; but if a value is
used repeatedly, it's easier to assign a meaningful symbolic name to it.
This is particularly the case if the value might change in the future.
</p>
<p>
we can also define a symbol in either of these two ways, which are
synonymous with using the <code>=</code> sign:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
    .equ SYS_EXIT 1
    .set SYS_EXIT 1
</pre>

<p>
Symbols defined this way do not have to be literal values -- they can
be expressions <i>that can be evaluated at assembly time</i>. For example,
it's legitimate, and often useful, to write:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
    WIDTH = 2
    HEIGHT = 3
    AREA = WIDTH * HEIGHT
    ...
    mov %r0, $AREA
</pre>

<p>
The <code>r0</code> register gets assigned the value 6, and we could just
as correctly have written:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock" lang="asm">
    AREA = 6 
    ...
    mov %r0, $AREA
</pre>

<p>
Still, it's often much more illustrative to define the constants in such
a way as to show how the values are assigned. Since symbol expressions are
evaluated at assembly time, it does not affect the operation of the 
program at run-time in any way to write an expansive set of definitions.
</p>
<p>
I'll be making more extensive use of symbols as the complexity of
the examples increases. 
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>We can define symbols to make assembly programs more readable,
and easier to maintain.</p></li>
<li><p>Symbols can be expressions, often in terms of other symbols. However, 
the expressions are evaluated at assembly time -- the values used at
run time will always be constants.</p></li>
</ul>
